Project Goals
The world's first fully synthetic plastic was invented in 1907 and was widely applied to various products in our daily life. 
This invention not only brought the convenience to our lifestyle but also caused a serious environmental problem 
during the past decades. The mismanagement of the plastic waste caused the irreversible crisis in the global scale. 
Plastic pollution is the result of plastic waste accumulating and adversely affecting the environment and ecosystems around it. The
world’s oceans are being hit the worst by this problem.

Our goal for hosting this website is to provide easy­to­digest information about the
plastic waste, educate the global citizens of this serious problem, and advocate people to take
action on protecting our earth in both governmental and individual levels.

To be more specific, we visualize the information about the production of the plastic, the
problem of the plastic pollution in the global and the USA levels, the mismanagement of plastic
around the world, where the plastic end up, the plastic bags banned policy and the suggested
actions that the individuals could take.
