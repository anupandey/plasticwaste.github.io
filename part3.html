  <h1>The Urgency of the Global Plastic Problem</h1>
  <p>In the U.S. and around the world, plastic has only been in widespread production for a little under 70 years. Since its invention, the production of plastic has been growing almost exponentially and even in that relatively short amount of time, production totals have reached an incredible <b>355 million metric tons</b>. Worldwide reliance on the disposable plastic packaging is overwhelming our planet.</p>

How much does the U.S contribute to plastic pollution?
</h1>
  <p>If you live hundreds of miles away from the coast, it probably never occurs to you that the plastic bag or the straw fragments that you toss into the sewer might make its way into the Atlantic or the Pacific. But somewhere between 40,000 and 110,000 metric tons of plastic waste generated by Americans end up in the ocean (Jambeck et al. 2015). This is the equivalent of throwing between 60 and 160 full-sized cars worth of weight in plastic into the ocean every day.</p>

  <p>One might think that because we produce so much plastic waste that we would be one of the main perpetrators, but in fact, the U.S. ranks 20th in the world for ocean pollution when it comes to plastic.

<h1>What is mismanaged waste? </h1>
<p>Mismanaged waste is waste that is not properly disposed of i.e., there isnâ€™t a formally managed waste management system. Highly populated China tops the rank of countries whose mismanaged plastic waste goes into the Oceans, but the US also featured in the top 20 and contributed a higher rate of waste per person (Jambeck et al, 2015)
