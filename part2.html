  <h1>The Problem Of Plastics </h1>
  <p>
  In 1907 the invention of Bakelite began a revolution in materials by introducing truly synthetic plastic resins into world commerce. Plastic is a polymeric materialâ€”that is, a material whose molecules are very large, often resembling long chains made up of a seemingly endless series of interconnected links. It is versatile, lightweight, flexible, moisture resistant, strong, and relatively inexpensive.

  Plastics don't react with materials like alcohol, gasoline, or acid, and thus they are great for storing stuff. Unfortunately, that also means that they don't decay. It instead divides down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro-plastics. These pieces can stick around for centuries and can be deadly to sea life if ingested. Everything from seabirds to whales can be seriously hurt or killed by this plastic. Millions of animals have already been killed as a result of plastic pollution, including many endangered species.

  By the end of the 20th century, however, plastics were found to be persistent polluters of several environmental niches, from Mount Everest to the bottom of the sea.
